A simple one-page webapp for money management

Written in pure JS/HTML with literally zero outside stuff. And it's actually one page. Not like "one page with 178 dependencies, 9 servers, 46 files, and 23 languages". `index.html` can be visited offline from the browser as a file with no problem. The Javascript and CSS were put in other files because I'm lazy, but cutting and pasting them in would turn this into a single-file application.
